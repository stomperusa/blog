      <description>Intro A friend had asked how I would approach using a regression model in R on this data set to determine if weather has any impact on Uber usage in New York City. I was intrigued to know the result and thought this would make a good first blog post. A call out to Yannis Pappas for making this dataset available. http://www.yannispappas.com/Exploring-Uber-Demand/
To recap, Yannis compiled the Uber Pickup data from the first 6 months of 2015 (from Kaggle), weather data from the National Centers for Environmental Information, LocationID to Borough mapping (by FiveThirtyEight) and NYC public holidays.</description>
